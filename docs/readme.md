<strong>NOTE: still under active development and I'm not currently providing backwards compatibility until things stabilize.</strong>

## üìØ Description

federated social web blog app. basically, i'm trying to build an open-source Tumblr (RIP). passes [SWAT0](https://indieweb.org/SWAT0)!

## üíæ Install

```sh
npm i lerna -g
lerna bootstrap --hoist
npm install
```

Then, to run your newly created server locally, **with** the Storybook styleguide server:

```sh
npm start
```

Or, to run locally **without** the Storybook styleguide server:

```sh
npm run serve:dev
```

To run in production (or better yet check out bin/flightplan.js)
```sh
npm --production install
npm run serve:prod
```

To locally develop the packages `hello-world-editor` and `social-butterfly`, run:
```sh
./bin/setup_local_dev_environment.sh

# To live update hello-world-editor code:
cd packages/hello-world-editor; npm run build

# To live update social-butterfly code:
cd packages/social-butterfly; npm run build
```


To run tests:
```sh
npm run test
```

## üéØ Goals

- pass [SWAT0](https://indieweb.org/SWAT0)
- open source
- easy to install
- be a good, easy-to-use alternative to what's out there!

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### p0 (high pri)

- split off dashboard, admin panel, draft.js code, auth0, and lodash code for performance
- separate packages for editor and socialize api
  - take a look at lerna: https://medium.com/@luisvieira_gmr/building-large-scale-react-applications-in-a-monorepo-91cd4637c131
  - social api:
    - provide function to generate RSA
    - provide function to generate <head> html
    - get rid of local fields: comments_count and comments_updated, favorites_count, derive instead
    - utility function for parsing 'acct:' maybe
    - move urls to constants (foaf, webfinger, etc.)
    - rename fields to be consistent
      - from_user: remoteProfileUrl,
      - local_content_name: localContentUrl,
      - to_username: localUsername,
      - avatar -> logo
    - maybe get rid of underscores vs camelCase
    - should go into a retry queue, async
- prbly move comments/favorites to separate 'social' table (also need to consolidate ‚Äòlocal‚Äô and ‚Äòremote' comments)
- make install instructions dead-simple, one-liner with mysql mock db setup.
- social features
  - verify salmon (fix todos), oStatus support, follow/favorite/reply, unfollow (skip xsrf, also push/pubsub), with status.net (a.k.a. gnu social), friendi.ca, Pleroma, socialhome, hubzilla
  - reference: https://ostatus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_structures.html
  - activitypub
    - alternate: https://github.com/dariusk/rss-to-activitypub
  - verify webmention working again
  - publish to fediverse.party and the-federation.info and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse
  - check out https://fed.brid.gy/
  - mastodon compatibility
  - see remote comments
  - WebSub (pubsubhubbub)
  - hacky URI decorations
  - see if ostatus is still case-sensitive, if not make all lower case foaf, webfinger, host_meta, too confusing with react warnings
- render HTML with inline styling
- getting an error in graphql seems to hang the apollo server. if so, update all-the-things, too.
- same Apollo query twice causes SSR to fail with htmlHead, wtf.
- more GraphQL examples:
  - fragments
    - also, things like fetchPublicUserData should be part of the graph not separate queries
  - local state
  - subscriptions
  - check out dataloader: https://github.com/graphql/dataloader
  - generate automatically schemas/typedefs
- generator steps for Sequelize files
- see if `lazy` attribute can be a good substitute for ContentThumb's delay-loading logic (chrome 75)
- finish up Admin panel to add/delete users
- prefer JSON for webfinger, easier
- webfinger - place at .well-known/webfinger
- loading state when following someone new
- invalid url (i.e. with http:) follow error on dashboard

### p1 (medium pri)

- web components? (e.g. check out youtube.com)
- update material-ui with proper theme (instead of pixel.css)
- should just follow self in dashboard, when posting new comment it goes to 'user remote' version.
- add site loading/working component, say when following a feed and it's working.
- hubspot's draft-extend / draft-convert might be a better route than draft-js-plugins, maybe combine the two editors
- more winston logging
- links template just open embeds in lightbox?
- editor features to bring back (from Python version)
  - use CSS-in-JS in editor package to avoid having to import separately
  - add snackbar close action
  - better emoji picker (can use EmojiOne's)
  - custom emojis
  - gotta fix @-mentioning for editing content (works for dashboard only now)
  - draft.js:
    - move paste code out of main index.js
    - custom tab behavior - draft.js's default is lame
    - add markdown
      - https://github.com/withspectrum/draft-js-markdown-plugin
      - https://github.com/ngs/draft-js-markdown-shortcuts-plugin
      - --- for divider
    - add inline-code
    - add empty newline always at end of doc
    - image upload progress (or indeterminate loading "spinner")
    - unfurl should have "(via link)"
    - take a look at utils codebase: https://github.com/jpuri/draftjs-utils
    - code, use prism syntax highlighting
    - google maps embed
    - can‚Äôt import CSS for some reason into webpack from node_modules (from draft-js-plugins)
    - DraftEntity.get/create deprecated
    - multiple images - single undo instead of two (also when pasting unfurl)
    - use something instead of ' ‚Äò and ‚Äòa‚Äô for atomic blocks
    - convertFromHTML bug - this will fail `<figure>    <img src="">  </figure>` but w/o whitespace won‚Äôt
    - toolbar don‚Äôt move on click (position so it doesn‚Äôt go off screen), get rid of scale
    - checklist / tasklist
    - dnd + align toolbars don‚Äôt actually work
    - htmlToEntity has extra data (entity and node both have the same data :-/), need to update attachment.js, unfurl.js, Iframe.js, Image.js, Blocks.js
  - create new sections / albums, renames (and redirects)
  - content rename (and redirects)
  - draggable, be able to drag album, sitemap, followers and move to different categories
  - simple content is uneditable
  - audio/video uploads
  - css/js live updates to wysiwyg
  - figcaption
- dashboard: better way to sandbox remote content?
- search should have InfiniteFeed
- bring back old features (from Python version)
  - data liberation, ability to port data to another site/service
  - themes
  - forums
  - events
  - store
  - slideshow
  - favorites and shares
  - spam control
  - webfinger if http://ostatus.org/schema/1.0/subscribe present then show Follow button for user
  - fb/google+/twitter mirroring (backwards compatibility ;)
  - media manager: had support for video/audio/images
  - resumable uploads
  - edit images
  - newsletter, google analytics, basic ads, adult content flag
  - Structured data w movies music
  - content management
    - drag & drop to move sections
    - drag & drop to move content in albums
    - have hidden content
    - change section/album/thumb/hidden/template/thumb in content editor
    - be able to delete from within content editor
- friendica, other webfinger/host-meta tech
  - check out oexchange (see friendica)
  - check out amcd (see friendica)
  - why does friendica have salmon magic-key at top level host-meta file?
