If you have a general question about the project we encourage you to post in GitHub Discussions instead of this issue tracker. The maintainers and other community members can provide help and answer your questions there: <INSERT LINK>

If you're looking for general information on using React, the React docs have a list of resources: <INSERT LINK>

If you've discovered a bug or would like to propose a change please use one of the other issue templates.

Thanks!
